# Network analysis of discussion threads on Reddit

I examine the structure of online discussion threads, with special regard to climate change related discussions on the 2020 Australian wildfires. I focus on online communities within the social news aggregation, content rating and social discussion platform Reddit.  

####  Research question:
How does the exposure to opposing views affect relatively homogeneous online communities? \\

Does only the isolation of echo chambers lead to opinion polarization, or is also the community's reaction towards contrary information reinforcing pre-existing views of the majority of its members? 

Note: Better way to calculate the depth of comment trees - use of longest-path metric of graph objects instead of depth indication in comment dataframe collected with PRAW (code will be updated shortly).
